My computer's IP Address on Kali is 172.217.2.36 I accessed this using the command: ifconfig. The WiFi connection is labeled with 'inet', while the ethernet connection would be labeled differently, such as with 'ether'.

5. How can you tell whether there's a process listening on a given port (e.g. port 80 or port 22) on a given host?

7. How can you retrieve and save a given web page (say https://google.com/ or https://carleton.edu/) in a file on your system?
curl --request GET "[link]" --output [filename]

8. How can you view the HTTP headers sent back from a specified web server when you request one of its pages?
Use the same command (curl --request GET "[link]" --output [filename]) but specify -IL.
AKA curl -IL --request GET "[link]" --output [filename]
The HTTP header sent TO the web server is first (ex: HTTP/2), followed by the HTTP header that is SENT BACK (ex:200).

9. How can you view the HTTP headers that your computer sends to the web server when you do the tasks in the previous two questions?
Again: curl -IL --request GET "[link]" --output [filename]
The HTTP header sent TO the web server is first (ex: HTTP/2), followed by the HTTP header that is SENT BACK (ex:200).
